## üßÆ Game Description

In **MathWizz**, a random arithmetic expression is generated using two random operands and one of four arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). Your challenge is to input the correct result of the expression within a certain time limit, which starts counting down from 30 seconds. The game provides instant feedback on your answers and keeps track of your score and tries.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking the "Start Game" button.
2. A random arithmetic expression will be displayed.
3. Input the correct result of the expression within the time limit.
4. If correct, your score increases by 2, and a new expression is generated.
5. If incorrect, the number of tries decreases by 1.
6. The game ends when you input 3 incorrect results or the time runs out.
7. Your score, remaining tries, and high score are displayed.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
